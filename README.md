### Guidelines for a new joined developer:

  To get started, follow below steps:

  Main Branch -> Master

    1) Fork the repository
    2) Make a clone in your local system.
    3) Make different branch for different features - make changes and commits in the respective branch only.
    4) Once test are suucessful, merge feature branch o your master branch.
    5) Push the changes to master branch of your forked repository.
    6) Create a pull request to merge the changes into official repository
    7) After code is reviwed, the code is then merged with the official repo.


Note:-
Pre-commit hooks:

For efficient feature and bug tracking , it is recommended that you strictly put JIRA ID of issues as a prefix to your commit comment else it will fail to commit.
For example : 
JIRA Id: 6785
Commit Message: 6785_your-commit-message
